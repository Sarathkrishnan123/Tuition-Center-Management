# Tuition-Center-Management

Project: Tuition Center Management System

Developed a comprehensive web-based application to streamline operations for a tuition center with distinct modules for Admin, Teacher, and Student. Key features include secure registration with live form validation, email-based account activation, and password management. The Admin module manages courses, assigns teachers/students, monitors attendance, and handles approvals. The Teacher module allows assignment management, student tracking, and attendance recording, while the Student module provides course access, assignment submission, and attendance viewing. The system is mobile-responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices.
